# Foundations of C# > C# Inheritance

## What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance links classes together and cuts down on "too much code"

## How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Well, not everything can be inherited. Constructors cannot be. And some can be private readonly. There can be single and transitive inheritance as well.

## How does accessibility affect inheritance?

If a class is private, it will fail to compile due to its protection level.
