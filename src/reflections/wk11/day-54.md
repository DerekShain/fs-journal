# Reflection

I had a great experience and learned a great amount of coding and how to code. I greatly feel that codeworks has prepared me for my future coding endeavors.

My concerns for the final project is time management. Trying to be flexible with work and the final will be difficult.

Ive really enjoyed just learning the different languages, structures, formats, and, what I see code as, puzzles. I like that I'm challenged and if I can't figure it out, I know my proper resources.
