## Wire Framing

# What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wire-framing provides a clear overview for developers and stakeholders before a website is written to make sure everything is where they need to be. It also clearly identifies and defines website features to clients who may not have the same lexicon.

# What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low-fidelity: the most basic visual representation of a webpage, usually a starting poingt thats hand drown to show where items are to go. 
Mid-fidelity: most commonly used, they feature more accurate representations via a computer drawn sketch. 
High-fidelity: boast pixel-specific layouts showing close to what the final project looks ike. Our figma project would be considered a High-fidelity mock-up

# Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I believe wire-frames are 100% worth the effort. It's always best to have a visual guide of what you want to make because it can help you code faster.
