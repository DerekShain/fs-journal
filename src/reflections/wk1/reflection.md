## Weekly reflection

# The learning curve.

There is so much more to learn than I had ever expected but I know the outcome will get me where I need to be. I'm learning things I thought I knew but, in all honesty I never really knew the full concept of. Even the smallest of things, like pushing a code with the structure to grab a specific item. 

There's still a lot more to learn and a lot more to practice but I know I'll get to where i need to be. 


# First Checkpoint

This is the outcome of what I have learned the first week. It took me a lot of hours and tweaking to get it where it needs to be. [Europa Space Enterprise's](https://derekshain.github.io/checkpoint1/)
