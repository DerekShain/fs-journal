# Git

## Why do we use Git?

One of the reasons we use Git is so developers who are working on the same project don't run into any conflicts when pushing content and by maintaining a history of changes if issues do arise. Another reason would be everything changes, especially in technology so someone other than the original publisher will need to go into make changes to keep up with changing technology. 

## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

One of reason to have multiple branches is that you can have the master branch live while you are working on an updated version of the code. 

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is a local repository while GitHub is a remote repository that other developers can have access to.
