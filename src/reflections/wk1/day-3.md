## Cheating your Design

# What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Personally I think using custom drop shadows really improves a design. Adding a drop shadow instead of a plain border gives the item a 3d appearance making it look more natural. 

# Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

CSS databases like Fontawesome and bootstrap, developer subreddits, and technology related websites. The reason I included technology websites to get a good design idea is because most of the time they strive for "new and improved". Technology is always advancing. Fontawesome and bootstrap because their whole system is based on CSS, and developer subreddits because you can get good functional ideas and troubleshooting ideas. 

# How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

If you look at a website that has very minimal design or css implementation, it looks either like it hasn't been updated since the 90's or it could be a fake website trying to steal your information. You can convey your message and your product through design alone when things are smooth and they work. Styles are constantly changing. Keeping up with the trends catches people's eyes.
