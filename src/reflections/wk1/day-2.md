## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A Pseudo-Class is a special state of an element. 
```selector:pseudo-class{
    property:value;
}```
I believe some of the most common pseudo-classes we will use will be :hover, :root, and :first-child.

Specificity is a tool built into css that determines which rule should be applied first if there are multiple rules. You can benefit from it's use by as you can quickly debug issues you may have. 

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Over-utilizing the !important feature can cause console log errors and issues with your code as multiple codes are trying to run at the same time.
