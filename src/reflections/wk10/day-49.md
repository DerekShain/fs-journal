Strongly typed constants. Allows you to assign symbolic names to integral values.

## How can you modify an Enum?

Using the Volume Enum. It modifies the base type and members.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I could have used it on all of my afternoon projects. I think rock paper scissors would have been the best to practice on.
