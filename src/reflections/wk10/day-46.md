# Foundations of C# > C# Data Types

## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

- Value Type - a data type that holds value within its own memory
- Reference Type - does not store data, but stores the address where the value is being stored.
- Pointer Type - do not inherit from objects.

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

The naming conventions are shorter and some are even different than JS.

- bool
- byte
- char
- decimal
- double
- enum
- float
- int
- long
- sbyte
- short
- struct
- uint
- ulong
- ushort

## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

It points to to where the data is actually stored at. Value types store the data while reference types refer the data.
