# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism

```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
staff.property
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A way to restrict access to data. The state is stored privately and only the objects methods can change it. 
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single Responsibility
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A class is a blueprint where you can create an object. An instance of a class is the object.
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
An object that wraps another object and intercepts the fundamental operations of that object. 
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It is an architectural pattern that separates the application into three logical components. It cleans up the look of the application and makes it easier to modify and look at the code. 
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Mediates communication between a controller and repository layer.
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Central Component. It is independent of user interface and directly manages data and logic.
