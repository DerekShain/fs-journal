## ES6 Modules

# What problem does using exports solve?

Using exports allows other modules to import them. When exporting an importing, it helps keep your line of code down.

# How does export differ from export default?

You can have multiple exports in a file, but only one export default. They can be used to achieve the same purpose. You want to use export default to specify the default output for the module; you won't need to know the variable name of the module to load.

# What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Modules can eradicate naming conflicts. Also, using ES6 your code can be organized better.
