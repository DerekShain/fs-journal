# Weekly Review


## A challenging week. 

There is a lot to learn with the MVC pattern and how it all works, along with tying everything into the local storage and ensuring it all works. It took me awhile to figure out what I was doing wrong but in the end it ended up being a word misspelled or a symbol missing. One thing I kept having issues with was my checkbox. It would not save to the local storage at first, but when I did get it to save to local storage, it would not populate. I had the word checker in place, and it needed to be checked. Just going over what I write and how I write will definitely help me out in the future. 

## Week 3 checkpoint

This weeks checkpoint was challenging but at the same time a fun experience.
