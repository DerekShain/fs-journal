## Intro to Javascript

# What is Scope ?

Scope is a policy that manages the availability of variables. A variable defined inside a scope is only available within that scope, but inaccessible outside.

# What is Hoisting ?

Code runs in a specific log. Code does it automatically but you can be put in order in order to be read and compiled properly. 

# In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Let is only available to use in your block of code. 

Const a variable that never changes and maintains constant values and can only be used in the block you declared.

Var can be used anywhere. it can be globally or locally scoped. any variable declared with var outside a function block can be used anywhere.
