# Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small teams

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

You would have shorter sprint plannings. Meetings wouldn't be as long. Everyone would be working a lot closer and communication would need to be more important. 

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

Things change. By running 1 sprint at a time you'll be able to address new additions or code that wont work. 

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

Tradeoffs between the speed of development and the quality of software delivered. 

* Good service Cheap won't be Fast
* Good service Fast won't be Cheap
* Fast service Cheap won't be good. 

It helps a team understanding tradeoffs and to set realistic expectations.
