# Reflect on your partner project 

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

Definitely used pair programming. We split things up but in the end had a navigator and driver role where one was doing research while the other codes. 

## What went well?

Splitting things up and using a common language. If we worded things different it completely confused us. 

## What would you do differently?

I would have implemented a driver and navigator earlier on. I think that would have helped solved issues sooner.
