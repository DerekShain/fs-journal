# Advancing with Vue 3 > Code documentation for JavaScript with JSDoc: an Introduction

## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Documentation on code you've written to help you remember how to use it and to share it with others.
* How To's
* README's
* in the source. 

## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

If you write something that solves an issue you have and you don't use it for a couple of months, you could forget how you solved it and will spend hours trying to recall. Also, sharing the tool with other developers will allow you to network and possibly utilize their documents as well. 

## How important is Code documentation and why?

It goes back to the last question. Coding is machine language, not plain english. It's a completely different and difficult language and with document how you solve problems, it just helps better prepare you for future projects.
