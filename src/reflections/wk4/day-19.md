# What is REST

##  What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REpresentational State Transfer. When a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the source requested. 

## What does Stateless mean?

The server doesn't remember anything about the user who uses the API. It can help protect a user. 

## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

* URLs should include nouns, not verbs.
* Use plural nouns only for consistency (no singular nouns).
* Use HTTP methods (HTTP/1.1) to operate.
* Use HTTP response status codes to represent the outcome of operations on resources.
