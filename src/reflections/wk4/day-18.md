# Async and Await

## What is the purpose of Async/Await?

Async/Await was designed to solve the issues the Promises brought along. You prepend await and the code will stop until the promise is resolved or rejected. 

## What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?

In order to await a promise inside a function, the function must be defined as ```async```. 

## What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

* The code is easier to read
* Async functions can be chained easily
* Debugging works better
