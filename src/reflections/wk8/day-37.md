## Why is communication on a small team important?

Communication is important because it helps with organizing who is working on what. You don't want to be spending hours on something and when you go to push you have merge conflicts. 

## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Adjusting communication methods to better work with time restraints. Also, don't try and do multiple things at a time. Do 1 sprint at a time.

Tradeoffs between the speed of development and the quality of software delivered.
