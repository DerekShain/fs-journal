# Working In a Professional Environment > Testing in Vue 

## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

* Unit Testing - test individual units of code
* Component Testing - Test most Vue components
* End-to-End (E2E) Testing - Testing during use

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I believe E2E testing will be the most useful. In order to have a successful product it must be user friendly. 

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Component testing. I think it would take too long to develop the tools to test all the data at once, when you can do it individually.
